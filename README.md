# GENTLYFICATION PROJECT

Mitigate gentrification with a gently tourism.

## IDEA

GENTLYFICATION sets an action plan to mitigate the gentrification generated by mass tourism in Barcelona and other European cities, while generating an available budget and paved road for public social housing and rental assistance for vulnerable families.

This is done by introducing Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning to transform the current algorithm used to collect taxes from tourists, rewarding healthy tourism and punishing harmful tourism.

This project won the Citython 2018 within the framework of the Smart City Week in Barcelona and was presented at Smart City Expo World Congress 2018.
